Given an ascending matrix:
[
  0, 2, 4, 8
  3, 7, 9, 10
  4, 8, 11, 13
  5, 9, 12, 14
]
where the rows are sorted in ascending order and columns are sorted in ascending order, but the rows are not continuous. Given a
number k. Write a method that tells us whether the value k is in our matrix. Your final solution should be
O(rows + col)
